*****************************************
************** HRDNZ Theme **************
*****************************************

To put content in the slider, open
slidercontent/content.htm and edit that
file.

Each slide of content must be contained
within the tags
<div class="contentdiv"> CONTENT HERE </div>

Anything placed within that must use inline
styling.

For ease of use, keep all images and other
files used in the slidercontent folder
within the theme.

You can make up to nine slides at any one
time. They are numbered automatically.
